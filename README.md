# Predicting Blood Oxygen Level from PPG Signals

**The main project repository for the Deep Learning Theory and Practice class term project**

_For getting the dataset in the form we want, initially the MATLAB script needed to be run. Then with the dataset you get from the MATLAB, you can run the Python script nameed Data_Reader_and_Fundamental_Readings script to make your dataset ready for the upcoming parts._

_If you do not want to go over the initial pipeline, I will upload the dataset file that I generated after each step._
